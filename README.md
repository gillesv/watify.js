Watify.js - The Web-Based Ever-Changing Symbol
-------------------------------------------

The **Watify** brand is represented by an ever-changing symbol, inspired by the [quantum uncertainty principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle). 

Conceptually, every time the **Watify** brand is shown, it should be unique. To accomplish this we wrote an app in [Processing](https://www.processing.org) that can randomly generate and output new symbols whenever a new one is needed. 

This project is a web-native port of that Processing app that allows the embedding of a dynamically generated **Watify** symbol in any webpage. It uses HTML5 Canvas, [jQuery](http://jquery.com), [LESS](http://lesscss.org) and [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com).

#### Features

Currently, **Watify.js** has the following features:

* **Native Rendering.** All Processing rendering algorithms have been ported to Javascript, meaning symbols generated by the web-version should be indistinguishable from ones generated by the desktop Processing-based app. 
* **Animation.** As well as static image generation, this script can also show an animated version, so it's constantly changing.
* **Customisable.** With some simple HTML5 data-* attributes you can customise the look of the symbol, switching between any of the four official colour-schemes (blue, red, yellow and green), turning the Watify type-mark and the "Stimulating Digital entrepreneurship" on or off, transparent backgrounds, and so forth.
* **Responsive.** The symbol resizes to fit the size of its containing DOM element, so it can be used in fluid or responsive layouts. If you don't need or want this behaviour, it can be toggled off.
* **Retina-ready.** Support for high-density displays is built-in, so it should look crisp on every device.
* **Progressively enhanced.** If no browser-support for HTML5 Canvas is detected (thanks to Modernizr), the library also contains a collection of pre-generated static images, and some logic to randomly show one of them. 
* **Right-Click > Save As.** If you toggle the data-cansave attribute, the script allows users to save the generated symbol as .png by right clicking on it.

How to use
----------

## Basic

#### HTML

**Watify.js** requires [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com). This example uses Modernizr's load() functionality to load **Watify.js** and its dependencies, but you can use your own loading strategy so long as both Modernizr (*with* canvas feature detection) and jQuery are included. 

In the HEAD of your document:

> <script src="PATH/TO/modernizr.js"></script>
> <script>
> 		Modernizr.load([
> 			'//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.js',
> 			'assets/js/watify.js'
> 		]);
> </script>

And then in your document's BODY you can put:

> <div class="wavefunction"></div>

wherever you want a **Watify** symbol to show up. 

*Watify.js* will use the element's measured dimensions to determine at which size it should render, so you'll need to write your own CSS to control the size at which the symbol is displayed.

#### CSS

**Watify.js** does not require CSS to function, but if you need to support older browsers that lack HTML5 canvas support, you must include the *watify.css* file (found in */assets/css/*), and also make sure the pre-generated fallback images (found in */assets/img/fallback/*) are uploaded.

> <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/watify.css" />

Should you wish to modify the contents of *watify.css*, you'll find the source *.less* file in */assets/less/watify.less*. 

## Customisation

#### HTML

The appearance and behaviour of the **Watify** symbol can be customised using HTML5 data-* attributes. The following attributes are supported:

> <div class="wavefunction"
>  data-typo="true|false"
>  data-tagline="true|false"
>  data-cansave="false|true"
>  data-animated="false|true"
>  data-transparent="true|false"
>  data-color="blue|red|yellow|green"
>  data-resizable="true|false"
>  data-keyframedistance="240"
>  ></div>

Each property's default values are listed first. These values are used whenever no data-* attribute is provided.

Most of these properties (like color, resizable, animated, etc.) are self-explanatory. Here's an overview of the less obvious ones:

* **data-cansave="true|false"**: allows or disallows the saving of generated symbols. Warning, for performance reasons it's  a good idea to not use this in combination with the data-animated="true" setting.
* **data-typo="true|false"**: toggles the display of the **Watify** type-mark and its "Stimulating Digital Entrepreneurs" tagline.
* **data-tagline="true|false"**: provided *data-typo* is *true*, this attribute toggles the display of the "Stimulating Digital Entrepreneurs" tagline. Set it to *false* to only show the **Watify** type-mark. 
* **data-keyframedistance="240"**: this determines the speed (expressed in *frames*) at which the symbol animates (the animation should run at maximum 60fps). Larger values mean slower animation, and vice-versa.
* **data-resizable="true|false"**: when this property is set to "false", the symbol will be generated at the measured size of the containing element when the DOM is first loaded, and then never changes again. If you're not building a responsive website, you can set this to false.
